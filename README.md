# Graph Editor with Algorithms Documentation

## Introduction

This Python script implements a Graph Editor with various graph algorithms. The application provides a GUI for creating and visualizing graphs, and it includes the following algorithms:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Hill Climbing
- Beam Search
- Branch and Bound
- A*

## Getting Started

To run the application, execute the script `graph_editor.py`. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to interact with the graph editor.

## Graph Editor Features

### Node and Edge Creation

- Left-click on the canvas to create a new node.
- Connect nodes by clicking on two nodes and providing an edge label.

### Selecting Start and Goal Nodes

1. Click the "Select Start and Goal Nodes" button.
2. Enter the labels of the start and goal nodes in the prompts.

### Running Algorithms

- Use the algorithm-specific buttons to execute the corresponding algorithm.
- Visualization of the algorithm's progress is displayed on the canvas.

### Deleting Nodes and Edges

- Use the "Delete Node" and "Delete Edge" buttons to remove nodes and edges.
- Enter the label of the node or edge to delete in the prompts.

### Clearing the Graph

- Click the "Clear Graph" button to remove all nodes and edges.

## Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- The BFS algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run BFS" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, queue size, path elements, and path cost.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

- The DFS algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run DFS" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, queue size, path elements, and path cost.

### Hill Climbing

- The Hill Climbing algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run Hill Climbing" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, path elements, and path cost.

### Beam Search

- The Beam Search algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run Beam Search" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, queue size, path elements, and path cost.
- Beam width is adjustable (default is 2).

### Branch and Bound

- The Branch and Bound algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run Branch and Bound" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, queue size, path elements, and path cost.

### A*

- The A* algorithm is executed by clicking the "Run A*" button.
- Visualization shows enqueues, extensions, queue size, path elements, and path cost.

## Deleting Nodes and Edges

- Use the "Delete Node" button to remove a selected node.
- Use the "Delete Edge" button to remove an edge by entering its label.

## Clearing the Graph

- Click the "Clear Graph" button to remove all nodes and edges.
